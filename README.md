#Search the uncensorable distributed Wikipedia on IPFS

After Turkey restricted acess to Wikipedia.org to its citizens [IPFS](ipfs.io) set out to create an uncensorable distrubuted Wikipdia to give everyone access to information. You can read more about their blog post [here](https://blog.ipfs.io/24-uncensorable-wikipedia/). 

Since IPFS currently only serves static content this is an attempt to search the distributed Wikipedia.
